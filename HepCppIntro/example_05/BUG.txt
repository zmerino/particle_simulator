This program prints the last number twice when reading the file.  The 
program is caused by the trailing '\n' character at the end of the last 
line.  After reading the last number the input file stream is not null and 
so the loop cycles one last time.

The bug could be fixed by either reading lines from the input stream and 
then parsing each line or by peaking beyond the \n to look for the eof.
